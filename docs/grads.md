### Annual Performance Review (APR)
* The APR is to be submitted in the 6th and 8th long semester (3rd and 4th year of your PhD)
* If a student started in Fall, then by the APR needs to be submitted by the end of the year (early December at the latest).
* Based on this timeline, I suggest the following:
